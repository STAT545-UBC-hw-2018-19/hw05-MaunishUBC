### Install necessary packages ###
```{r}
library('gapminder')
library('kableExtra')
library('RColorBrewer')
library('plotly')
library('dplyr')
library('forcats')
library('readr')
```

### Factor management ###


What are the continent's in gapminder
```{r}
unique(gapminder$continent)
```

Oceania isn't a continent! Let's drop it!!
```{r}
gapminder_no_oceania <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent != "Oceania")

```

Also let's see what countries are there in Oceania
```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent == "Oceania") %>% 
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling()
```
So, Oceania has two countries, Australia and New Zealand.

```{r}

gapminder %>% 
  str()
 
```
So, gapminder has 142 levels for countires and 5 levels for continent

Let's see what happens after removing Oceania
```{r}
gapminder_no_oceania <- gapminder_no_oceania %>% 
  droplevels()

gapminder_no_oceania %>% 
  str()
```
There are 140 countries and 4 continents. 

The 4 continents make sense but why 140 countries? Where did 2 countries go?

Let's look at the differnce between gapminder_no_oceania and gapminder:
```{r}
anti_join(gapminder, gapminder_no_oceania, by = "country") %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling()
```
So, I'd like to reorder the countries in gapminder_no_oceania based on a modified metric which includes lifeeExp and gdpPercap 

So, *ideal* will be the new varialbe = lifeExp/max(lifeExp)*log(gdpPercap)/max(log(gdpPercap))

```{r}
gapminder_ideal <- gapminder_no_oceania %>% 
  mutate(ideal = lifeExp/max(lifeExp)*log(gdpPercap)/max(log(gdpPercap))) %>% 
  arrange(desc(ideal))

gapminder_ideal %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling()
```

Let's explore the factors in gapminder_ideal
```{r}
gapminder_ideal %>% 
  str()
```

So, the factor list is yet ordered alphabetically.

Let's change that based on our *ideal* metric:
```{r}
gapminder_ideal <- gapminder_ideal %>% 
  mutate(country = fct_reorder(country, desc(ideal)))

gapminder_ideal %>% str()

```

### File I/O

Let's look at Oceania Now: 

```{r}
gapminder_oceania <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent == "Oceania") %>% 
  droplevels()

gapminder_oceania %>% 
  str()
```

Let's reorder it by smallest to highest lifeExp 
```{r}
gapminder_oceania <- gapminder_oceania %>% 
  mutate(country = fct_reorder(country, lifeExp))

gapminder_oceania %>% 
  str()
```

Let's write this as a csv 
```{r}
gapminder_oceania_data <- tempfile()
write_csv(gapminder_oceania, 'oceania_data.csv')
```

Let's read it back and genrate the table
```{r}
read_csv('oceania_data.csv') %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling()
```

### Visualization design ###

Let's look at the ideal scale for the continents in gapminder_ideal for the year 2007: 

```{r}
gapminder_ideal %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = continent, y = ideal)) +
  geom_violin()

```

Let's get each country on here and colour it based on it's population 

```{r}
ideal_plot <- gapminder_ideal %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = continent, y = ideal)) +
  geom_violin(aes(fill = continent)) + 
  geom_point(aes(colour=pop)) +
  scale_colour_continuous(trans="log10") +
  labs(title = "Ideal metric for each of the continents") + 
   theme_bw() +
    theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 16),
          strip.background = element_rect(fill = "orange"),
          panel.background = element_rect(fill = "pink"))

ideal_plot
  
```

Let's make this a plotly object.
```{r}
ideal_plot %>% 
    ggplotly()
```
We can hover over each of the data points


### Save the figure

```{r}
ggsave("gapminder_ideal_plot.png", plot = ideal_plot, width = 5 , height = 4 , scale = 1)
```
